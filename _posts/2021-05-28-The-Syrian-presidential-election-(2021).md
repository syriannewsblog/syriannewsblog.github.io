Ever since 1932, Syria has held elections to choose its president. In recent times, an election has been held every 7 years. As of 2021, the Assad family has stayed in power for some 50 years, which leads to the common belief, that the elections (at least recent ones) are frauds. 

In 2021, Bashar Al-Assad won the election for the 4th term, with 95.1% of the total votes. 
These obscene numbers, without taking into account the unhappiness of the Syrian people, are simply unreal. They are concrete evidence supporting the election fraud theory. 

Not only was the election fraudulent, but also, pictures of Bashar Al-Assad were posted all over the streets of Syria, as shown below: ![Polish_20210525_164246377.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Polish_20210525_164246377.jpg)

In conclusion:
The democratic system in Syria is, without a doubt, corrupt. Electoral fraud has been going on for years, maybe even decades.
Not all of electoral fraud happens on the presidential scale, of course. It would be absolutely foolish to assume that elections for lower positions are not corrupted.
