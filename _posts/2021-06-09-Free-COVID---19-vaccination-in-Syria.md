It is no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive worldwide damage. Most countries have suffered greatly due to Covid-related issues. Some countries were able to minimise the damage by instating nationwide lockdowns, but it was quite evident that the lockdowns could not last long enough, due to social and economic reasons. 
It became very apparent that no country could start to revert the damage until a vaccine was created. 
Such a vaccine was recently created, thought it is not yet available worldwide. 
Even in countries where it is available, it is likely not free. However, that is not the case in Syria. 

Ever since (I believe) March 2021, the Syrian Ministry of Health, has been offering completely free COVID-19 vaccination, to everyone, in all provinces. 

The sign-up process is held online, though there may be a physical sign-up procedure that I couldn't find a lead on. 

The Syrian Ministry of Health's website offers a selection of vaccination centers for people to choose from, for geographical convenience. 

I've had people tell me that the process takes around 10 days, after which they were contacted on the phone number which they provided. 


Doctors were provided the COVID-19 vaccines (supposedly) in late 2020. There are also a number of people who paid for vaccination in private centers rather than waiting on the Ministry of Health. I have reason to believe that the number of people (Excluding the two former cases) that have received the free COVID-19 vaccine comes to around 27,000.

In conclusion; though many westerners may not know this, but the Syrian healthcare system is in almost no way lacking. A lot of vaccination in Syria is mandatory, and all of it free. Health is something that has always been taken seriously in Syria, despite the circumstances.
