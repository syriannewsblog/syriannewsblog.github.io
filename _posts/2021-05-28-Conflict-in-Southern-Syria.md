The southern parts of Syria are without a doubt, a hot-spot for conflict. I will do my best to portray the relevant information I have regarding the south. I can't promise that this is everything going on in the south, but I can promise that I will tell everything I know, without altering what I believe to be the truth. As usual, I can assure nothing but honesty. 

The areas I will be covering are:

Golan
Deraa
Al-Qunitra
Al-Souida

Golan:

Golan, commonly referred to as Golan Heights, is a part of Syria, that has long been under control of Israel. There have been many battles over the control of Golan for decades. It is believed that residents of Golan, whom did not succumb to Israel, continue to receive harsh, unfair treatment. 
The loss of Golan was, and still is, a major inconvenience for Syria. Not only is Golan considerably large, but also, virtually anything can be grown in its soil. 

Deraa:

Deraa was the first province to experience protests. Though it used to be home to constant battles, it is now, for the most part calm (As calm as calm can be given the situation).
Deraa is currently occupied by Syrian forces, and Jabhat al-Nusra. 
There are ISIS forces in the region, though they mostly lay low. 

Al-Qunitra:

Al-Qunitra was mostly abandoned, due to conflicts with Israel over Golan. 
As of now, it is occupied by UN forces to prevent conflict over it. 

Al-Souida:

Al-Souida is occupied by Derouz, Hezboallah, and Syrian forces. All three parties are located in the same regions. 
Derouz have considerably more power than Hezboallah and the Syrian forces (In Al-Souida, that is), and constantly continue to pick fights with and harass them both. 
There is also a considerable amount of ISIS forces there, but mostly they lay low.
