The northern parts of Syria are home to many conflicts, due to the fact that it is rich with natural resources. I will try and demonstrate what types of conflicts are occurring in the following areas:

Al-Raqqah

Al-Hasaka

Aleppo

Idlib

The Euphrates River


Al-Raqqah:

Al-Raqqah has a fair amount of oil and phosphate. It is occupied by US forces, ISIS forces, and Kurds. Al-Raqqah also has many IDP camps. Al-Raqqah is a location desired by Kurdistan. 

Al-Hasaka:

Al-Hasaka is extremely oil-rich, it also has other various natural resources. It is occupied by US forces, Russian forces, Iranian forces, Turkish forces, ISIS forces, Kurds, and Syrian forces. It is also home to a few IDP camps. 

Aleppo:

Aleppo is mostly occupied by Syrian forces, but parts of it are occupied by Jabhat AL-Nusra, Russian forces, and Iranian forces. Aleppo is a relatively wealthy area, and was able to fund many repairs. Most conflict in Aleppo is gang-related, though most gangs are subsidiaries of the larger aforementioned factions. 

Idlib:

Most of Idlib is occupied by Turkish forces, the rest is occupied by Russian forces. Russian forces ransack the abandoned houses in Idlib, and send whatever they find back to their homes. 
Meanwhile, Turkey has built hospitals and schools. Turkish schools in Idlib teaches all subjects from a very Islamic standpoint, and has a dedicated Islamic subject, none of which is present in Turkey. The Turkish government doesn't give any sort of support to residents of Idlib, unless they learn the Turkish language. The Turkish government supposedly also gave out expired vaccines. Mind the word supposedly, I couldn't find much evidence to back this claim, but I thought it was worth mentioning without saying whether it is true or not. Turkey promised a salary of 1000$ USD to any Idlib resident who fights with Turkey in Libya and Azerbaijan.

The Euphrates River:

The Euphrates Dam located on the Euphrates River is the biggest dam in Syria, and was a very important source of power before the war.
During the war, the dam was under assault by ISIS forces.
The US forces continued to prevent Turkish forces from entering deeper into Syria, as the US didn't want Turkey to get its hands on the oil and phosphate found in the northern parts of Syria. In response, Turkey blocked off the Euphrates River, in an attempt to make the residents of Syria put pressure on the US. This caused a drought in Al-Raqqah and in Al-Hasaka. Iraq was also negatively affected by this.
